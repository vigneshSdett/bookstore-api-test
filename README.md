# Bookstore API Automation Project

This repository contains an end-to-end API automation framework built for a FastAPI-based Bookstore application. The tests are written in Java using RestAssured and Cucumber, with reporting via Extent Reports. The project also includes automated server startup and supports CI/CD pipelines.

## Tech Stack

| Layer           | Technology         |

## Setup & Execution

### 1. Backend Server (Automated)

No need to start the FastAPI server manually. It's launched automatically before the tests begin using Java ProcessBuilder.

Example code:
```java
ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("uvicorn", "main:app", "--reload");
pb.directory(new File("bookstore-main"));
pb.redirectErrorStream(true);
```

### 2. Run Tests

```bash
mvn clean verify
```

- Starts the FastAPI server
- Executes all Cucumber test scenarios
- Generates an HTML test report

## Test Scenarios Covered

## Reporting

After test execution, view the detailed report:

```
target/cucumber-reports/ExtentReport.html
```

Includes:
- Scenario-wise results
- Request and response logs
- Assertions and validations

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project supports CI/CD integration using GitHub Actions.

### Sample GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: windows-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '17'

    - name: Install Python dependencies
      run: |
        cd bookstore-main
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Start FastAPI server
      run: |
        start uvicorn main:app --reload
      working-directory: bookstore-main

    - name: Run API Tests
      run: mvn clean verify
```
